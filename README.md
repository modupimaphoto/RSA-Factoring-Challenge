# RSA Factoring Challenge

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts data-in-motion. It uses a key pair that is mathematically linked to encrypt and decrypt data. A public and private key are created, with the public key being accessible to anyone and the private key being a secret known only by the key pair creator. Either the private or public key can encrypt the data, while the other key decrypts it. This makes RSA ideal for sending sensitive information across a network or Internet connection, where the recipient of the data sends the data sender their public key.

RSA factoring is a mathematical problem that involves finding the prime factors of a large composite number. It is used in the RSA public-key cryptosystem, which is widely used to secure online communication and transactions.
